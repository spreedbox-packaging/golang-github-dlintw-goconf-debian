Description: Goconf is a configuration file parser for Golang.
 It is based on goconfig. Goconf has a few new features:
 * It gives more detailed errors
 * There is no need to specify a section name in the configuration file
   ("default" is assumed as the section name)
 * It can now read from a byte slice or io.Reader
 * It can now write to a byte slice or io.Writer
 * It Compiles! It works with go version 1 and later.
